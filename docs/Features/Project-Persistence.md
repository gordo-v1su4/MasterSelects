# Project Persistence

[← Back to Index](./README.md)

Local project folder storage with continuous save by default, optional interval autosave, backups, and smart media relinking. Supports two backends: **File System Access API** (Chrome/Edge) and **Native Helper** (Firefox when the helper is connected).

## Welcome Overlay

### First Launch
On first launch or when no project is open, the Welcome Overlay appears:
- Animated entrance with blur backdrop
- "Local. Private. Free." tagline (typewriter effect with deliberate typo correction)
- Two options: **New Project** or **Open Existing**
- **Start editing** button (or press Enter) to skip without persistence

### Browser Handling

| Browser | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| Chrome / Edge / Chromium | Full FSA support -- folder picker opens natively |
| Firefox | Uses **Native Helper** backend for persistence when the helper is connected |
| Safari / other | **"Unsupported Browser"** warning with Chrome download link |

For Firefox users:
- The overlay checks if the Native Helper is running and connected
- If available, activates the native backend and shows "New Project" / "Open Existing" buttons (using the OS folder picker via Native Helper)
- If unavailable or outdated, persistence is unavailable until the helper is installed and connected

### Select Project Folder
1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Choose or create a folder for your project
3. App creates the project folder with `project.json` plus the standard subfolders (`Raw/`, `Downloads/`, `Proxy/`, `Cache/`, `Analysis/`, `Transcripts/`, `Renders/`, `Backups/`)
4. Folder handle stored in IndexedDB (FSA) or path stored in localStorage (`ms-native-last-project-path`) for future sessions

### Continue Without Saving
- Click **"Start editing"** or press **Enter**
- Work without persistence
- Project lost on refresh
- Useful for quick experiments

## Storage Backends

The project system supports two backends, selected automatically based on browser capabilities:

### FSA Backend (Chrome / Edge)
- Uses the [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API)
- `showDirectoryPicker()` for folder selection
- `FileSystemDirectoryHandle` + `FileSystemFileHandle` for all I/O
- Handles stored in IndexedDB (`fsHandles` store) for session persistence
- Permission re-requested on page reload if needed

### Native Helper Backend (Firefox)
- Uses a local Rust helper (`tools/native-helper`) communicating via WebSocket (port 9876) and HTTP (port 9877)
- OS folder picker via `NativeHelperClient.pickFolder()`
- File I/O via `NativeHelperClient.writeFile()` / `readFileText()` / `writeFileBinary()` plus `createDir()`, `deleteFile()`, `rename()`, `exists()`, `listDir()`, and `pickFolder()`
- Project files are written through the helper's path-based storage layer; the browser never needs a `FileSystemDirectoryHandle`
- Last project path stored in `localStorage` key `ms-native-last-project-path`
- No permission prompts needed -- the Native Helper has full filesystem access
- Project listing: `NativeProjectCoreService.listProjects()` scans the project root for directories containing `project.json`
- The default project root comes from the helper (`Documents/MasterSelects` when available, otherwise `Home/MasterSelects`, or `MASTERSELECTS_PROJECT_ROOT` when set to an absolute path)

### Backend Switching
The `ProjectFileService` facade routes all calls to the active backend:
- `projectFileService.activeBackend` -- returns `'fsa'` or `'native'`
- `projectFileService.activateNativeBackend()` -- switches to Native Helper
- `projectFileService.activateFsaBackend()` -- switches back to FSA

## Project Folder Structure

Projects are stored in a local folder you choose:

```
MyProject/
+-- project.json           # Main project file
+-- .keys.enc              # Encrypted API keys (auto-saved with project)
+-- Raw/                   # Auto-copied media files (portable)
|   +-- Interview_01.mp4
|   +-- Music.wav
+-- Downloads/             # Downloaded videos (platform subfolders)
|   +-- YT/
|   |   +-- video_title.mp4
|   +-- TikTok/
|   +-- Instagram/
|   +-- Twitter/
|   +-- Facebook/
|   +-- Reddit/
|   +-- Vimeo/
|   +-- Twitch/
+-- Backups/               # Auto-backup folder
|   +-- project_2026-01-11_14-00-00.json
|   +-- ... (last 20 backups)
+-- Proxy/                 # Generated proxy video/audio files
+-- Cache/                 # Cached derived data
|   +-- thumbnails/        # Media thumbnails (WebP, keyed by file hash)
|   +-- splats/            # Cached Gaussian splat runtimes
|   +-- waveforms/         # Waveform data (Float32Array binary)
+-- Analysis/              # Clip analysis data (per media file)
+-- Transcripts/           # Transcript data (per media file)
+-- Renders/               # Exported renders
```

Folder constants defined in `src/services/project/core/constants.ts`:

```typescript
const PROJECT_FOLDERS = {
  RAW: 'Raw',
  PROXY: 'Proxy',
  ANALYSIS: 'Analysis',
  TRANSCRIPTS: 'Transcripts',
  CACHE: 'Cache',
  CACHE_THUMBNAILS: 'Cache/thumbnails',
  CACHE_WAVEFORMS: 'Cache/waveforms',
  RENDERS: 'Renders',
  BACKUPS: 'Backups',
  DOWNLOADS: 'Downloads',
};
```

### Auto-Copy to Raw Folder
When importing media files (controlled by `copyMediaToProject` setting):
- Files are **copied** to the project's `Raw/` folder
- Original files remain untouched at their source location
- If a file with the same name and size already exists, reuses the existing copy
- If a file with the same name but different size exists, adds a numeric suffix
- The copied `Raw/` file becomes the canonical source for relinking when it exists
- Project becomes portable -- copy the folder to another machine

### Auto-Relink from Raw Folder
When opening a project with missing media files:
- App automatically scans the `Raw/` folder for matching files first
- Matches by **filename only** (case-insensitive)
- Files are restored from Raw without user intervention
- If the Raw copy is not available, it falls back to stored file handles in IndexedDB
- Includes retry logic for handles that may not be immediately ready

### Benefits of Local Storage
- **No browser storage limits** -- use as much disk space as needed
- **Portable projects** -- copy folder (including Raw/) to move between machines
- **External backup** -- use any backup tool on the folder
- **Version control** -- can use Git for project history

---

## Auto-Save

### How Auto-Save Works
There are two save modes in the current branch:

1. **Continuous save** (default): `projectLifecycle.ts` subscribes to the media, timeline, FlashBoard, dock, and download-related stores, marks the project dirty, and writes the project after a short debounce. Keyframe changes flush more aggressively.
2. **Interval save**: `Toolbar.tsx` can still run a timer-based autosave loop. In this mode, the timer creates a backup first and then saves the project.

### Autosave Configuration
Access via **Settings -> General** for save mode, plus **File -> Autosave** for the interval controls:

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Save Mode | `continuous`, `interval` | **continuous** |
| Enable Autosave | On/Off | **On** |
| Interval | 1, 2, 5, 10 minutes | 5 min (interval mode only) |

Settings persist in `settingsStore` (localStorage).

### Automatic Dirty Marking
The `setupAutoSync()` function (in `projectLifecycle.ts`) subscribes to store changes and marks the project dirty when:
- Media files, compositions, or folders change (mediaStore)
- Clips or tracks change (timelineStore)
- YouTube panel state changes
- Dock layout changes
- Export settings or export presets change

### Manual Save
- `Ctrl+S` shortcut
- File menu -> Save
- Shows yellow "Saved" toast in center of screen
- Syncs all store state to project data, then writes `project.json`

### On Page Unload
In continuous-save mode, `beforeunload` flushes the pending store sync and kicks off a final best-effort project write. This still cannot fully guarantee the disk write completes before the page closes, but it is more aggressive than the old "memory only" unload path.

---

## Backup System

### How It Works
Before each **interval autosave** (the timer-driven File menu path), the current project file is automatically backed up:
1. Read current `project.json` content from disk
2. Copy to `Backups/` folder with timestamp name
3. Name format: `project_2026-01-11_14-30-00.json`
4. Then save the updated project to `project.json`

### Backup Storage
```
ProjectFolder/
+-- project.json          # Current project
+-- Backups/
    +-- project_2026-01-11_14-00-00.json
    +-- project_2026-01-11_14-05-00.json
    +-- ... (last 20 backups)
```

### Automatic Cleanup
- Keeps only the **last 20 backups** (`MAX_BACKUPS` constant)
- Oldest backups automatically deleted
- Sorted by file modification timestamp

### Restoring from Backup
1. Navigate to `ProjectFolder/Backups/`
2. Find backup by timestamp
3. Copy to `project.json` (rename existing first)
4. Reopen project

---

## Media Relinking

### Auto-Reconnect on Project Load
When opening a project, the app automatically:
1. Tries to get file handles from in-memory cache
2. Falls back to stored handles in IndexedDB
3. Checks read permission on restored handles
4. Scans the `Raw/` folder for missing files (exact filename match, case-insensitive)
5. Also checks stored IndexedDB handles for files not found in Raw
6. Regenerates missing object URLs for files that were restored successfully and rebuilds previews when the underlying `File` object is still available

### Reload All Button
In Media Panel toolbar:
- Click "Reload All" to restore file permissions
- Useful after browser restart
- Re-requests access to stored file handles

### Visual Indicators
| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Yellow badge | File needs reload (permission lost) |
| Red badge | File missing (needs relink) |
| Normal | File accessible |

---

## What Gets Saved

### Project Data (project.json)
```typescript
interface ProjectFile {
  version: 1;
  name: string;
  createdAt: string;     // ISO 8601
  updatedAt: string;     // ISO 8601

  settings: {
    width: number;       // Default 1920
    height: number;      // Default 1080
    frameRate: number;   // Default 30
    sampleRate: number;  // Default 48000
  };

  media: ProjectMediaFile[];
  compositions: ProjectComposition[];
  folders: ProjectFolder[];

  activeCompositionId: string | null;
  openCompositionIds: string[];
  expandedFolderIds: string[];

  slotAssignments?: Record<string, number>;
  mediaSourceFolders?: string[];
  youtube?: ProjectYouTubeState;
  uiState?: ProjectUIState;
}
```

### Per Composition
- All tracks and clips
- Clip positions and durations
- Trim points (inPoint/outPoint)
- Transform properties (position, scale, rotation, anchor, opacity, blend mode)
- Keyframe animations
- Effect parameters
- Mask shapes (vertices, mode, feather, opacity)
- Audio settings (volume, audioEnabled)
- Speed/reverse/disabled flags
- Nested composition references
- Text clip properties
- Solid clip color
- Vector animation settings (loop, end behavior, fit, animation selection, background)
- Transcript and analysis data per clip
- Scene description data

### Media Metadata
- File paths (relative to source folder)
- Duration, dimensions, FPS
- Codec, audio codec, container info
- Bitrate and file size
- hasAudio flag
- Proxy status
- Vector animation metadata (provider, animation names, default animation, frame count)
- Folder organization (folderId)
- `projectPath` when the file is copied into `Raw/`

### UI State (saved per project)
- Dock/panel layout
- Composition view state per composition (playhead, zoom, scroll, in/out points)
- Media panel column order and name width
- Transcript language preference
- View toggles: thumbnails, waveforms, proxy, transcript markers
- Changelog preferences (`showChangelogOnStartup`, `lastSeenChangelogVersion`)
- Export panel state: live export settings, named export presets, and the selected preset

### Other Persisted Panels
- YouTube panel state is saved in `project.json`
- FlashBoard workspace state is saved in `project.json` when boards exist

### Stored in Project Folder
| Location | Contents |
|----------|----------|
| `project.json` | Main project data |
| `.keys.enc` | Encrypted API keys |
| `Backups/` | Auto-backup files |
| `Raw/` | Copied media files |
| `Downloads/` | Downloaded videos (per platform) |
| `Proxy/` | Proxy video/audio files |
| `Cache/thumbnails/` | Media thumbnails (WebP) |
| `Cache/waveforms/` | Waveform data |
| `Analysis/` | Clip analysis cache |
| `Transcripts/` | Transcript data |
| `Renders/` | Exported renders |

---

## Project Management

### New Project
- File menu -> New Project (`Ctrl+N`)
- Prompts for project name
- Opens folder picker (FSA) or OS folder picker (Native Helper)
- Creates project subfolder with `project.json` and all required subfolders

### Save Project
- `Ctrl+S` saves to project folder
- Shows yellow "Saved" toast
- Syncs all stores to project format, then writes `project.json`
- Also updates `.keys.enc` with current API keys

### Save As
- File menu -> Save As (`Ctrl+Shift+S`)
- Prompts for new project name
- Creates a new project in the same parent folder
- Current state synced to the new project

### Open Existing Project
- From Welcome Overlay: "Open Existing"
- Or File menu -> Open Project (`Ctrl+O`)
- Select folder containing `project.json`

### Rename Project
- Double-click the project name in the toolbar
- Validates name (no special characters `<>:"/\|?*`)
- If parent folder handle has write permission, renames the folder on disk
- Otherwise, updates only the display name in `project.json`

### Restore Last Project
On app load, attempts to restore the previously opened project:
- **FSA**: Retrieves `lastProject` handle from IndexedDB, checks permission
- **Native**: Reads path from `localStorage` key `ms-native-last-project-path`
- If permission is needed, shows a "Grant Access" prompt
- If the project folder no longer exists, the saved path is cleared and the user must choose/open another project

---

## Layout Persistence

### Dock Layout
Saved per project in `uiState.dockLayout` within `project.json`:
- Panel positions
- Tab arrangements
- Panel sizes

### View Toggle Persistence
View toggle states saved in the project file (`uiState`):
- Thumbnail visibility (on/off)
- Waveform visibility (on/off)
- Proxy enabled (on/off)
- Transcript markers visibility
- Restored when opening a project

### Output Manager Persistence
The Output Manager window state is tracked via `localStorage`:
- `masterselects-om-open` key stores whether the Output Manager was open
- On page refresh, the app detects the existing popup and reconnects via `reconnectOutputManager()`
- Uses `sessionStorage` guard to prevent false reconnection on fresh tabs
- Window position and size preserved by the browser's named window (`output_manager`)

### Composition Resolution Persistence
Each composition stores its own resolution (width/height) in the project file:
- Resolution is saved per composition, not globally
- Changing resolution adjusts clip transforms proportionally (auto-reposition)
- Restored when opening a project or switching compositions

### Actions
```typescript
saveNamedLayout()      // View -> Layouts
loadSavedLayout()      // View -> Layouts
setDefaultSavedLayout()// View -> Layouts
saveLayoutAsDefault()  // View -> Layouts
resetLayout()          // View -> Layouts
```

## Troubleshooting

### IndexedDB Error Dialog
If IndexedDB storage becomes corrupted, an error dialog appears automatically:
- Explains the issue and provides instructions for clearing site data
- Offers a "Refresh" button to reload the app after clearing
- Dismissable via Escape key or backdrop click
- Source: `src/components/common/IndexedDBErrorDialog.tsx`

### Project Not Loading
1. Check if `project.json` exists in folder
2. Verify folder permissions
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify project `version` is `1`

### Missing Media After Reload
1. Click "Reload All" in Media Panel
2. Check if source folder is accessible
3. Verify files exist in `Raw/` folder

### Restore from Backup
1. Navigate to `ProjectFolder/Backups/`
2. Find backup by timestamp
3. Copy to `project.json` (rename existing first)
4. Reopen project

## Storage Comparison

| Storage | Used For | Limits |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Project Folder** | Project data, proxies, analysis, transcripts, cache, renders | Disk space |
| **IndexedDB** | File handles, media metadata, proxy frames (legacy), analysis cache, thumbnails | ~50MB |
| **localStorage** | App settings, autosave config, named/default dock layouts, dock layout fallback, Native Helper last project path | ~5MB |
