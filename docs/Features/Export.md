# Export

[Back to Index](./README.md)

Video export, audio export, transparent stacked-alpha export, FFmpeg WASM export, and FCPXML interchange.

---

## Overview

The export panel currently exposes three live encoder paths:

- `webcodecs` for the fast frame-by-frame pipeline
- `htmlvideo` for the precise HTML-video-seeking pipeline
- `ffmpeg` for the CPU FFmpeg WASM pipeline

There is also a separate FCPXML export action for NLE interchange.

### Current Panel Layout

- A sticky summary bar at the top shows only compact badges for mode, workflow, output, range, duration, and estimated size.
- The main form is split into exactly two groups: `Video` and `Audio`.
- The `Video` group now contains workflow selection, output naming, resolution, frame rate, delivery presets, codec controls, stacked-alpha, and range toggles.
- The `Audio` group contains output naming for audio-only exports, sample rate, bitrate, normalization, and audio-only range controls.

## WebCodecs And HTMLVideo Export

`FrameExporter` is used for both the WebCodecs and HTMLVideo export buttons.

### Fast Mode

- Uses WebCodecs sequential decoding for a single clip.
- Uses `ParallelDecodeManager` when multiple clips are present in the export range.
- Parses source media with MP4Box.
- Prefetches frames ahead of the render position.
- Can fall back to HTMLVideo-based precise export on specific decode or file-size failures.

### Precise Mode

- Uses detached `HTMLVideoElement` instances and browser seeking.
- Tries to wait for ready state and a fresh frame before export captures.
- Is slower than fast mode, but it is the compatibility fallback when fast mode fails.

### Automatic Fallbacks

- Large source media can bypass fast mode and switch directly to precise mode.
- Fast mode also retries precise mode on known decode / buffer / unsupported-file failures.

### Current File-Size Thresholds

- Single source file limit: 1.5 GB
- Total source files limit: 2 GB

These are current code limits, not generic recommendations.

## Output Codec Support

### WebCodecs / HTMLVideo Export

Supported containers:

- MP4
- WebM

Supported codecs are checked at runtime:

- H.264
- H.265
- VP9
- AV1

### Runtime Behavior

- WebM is limited to VP9 or AV1.
- MP4 accepts the full codec list, but browser support is still checked with `VideoEncoder.isConfigSupported()`.
- Unsupported combinations are not silently promised by the docs; they must pass the runtime checks or be remapped by the encoder logic.

---

## Stacked Alpha Export

`stackedAlpha` is supported in the WebCodecs / HTMLVideo export path.

### How It Works

- The export canvas height is doubled.
- The top half contains RGB.
- The bottom half contains alpha as grayscale.
- `OutputPipeline` mode `2` and `ExportCanvasManager` handle the stacked-alpha render path.

### Limitation

- This is a stacked-alpha format, not a conventional single-layer transparent video container.

---

## Audio Export

Audio export is handled separately from the video encoder.

### Current Flow

- Audio is extracted from the selected timeline range.
- `AudioExportPipeline` renders the mixed audio.
- WebCodecs export can mux the audio chunks into the final file.

### Supported Behavior

- AAC is used for MP4 when supported.
- Opus is used for WebM when supported.
- If the browser cannot encode a usable audio format, the export can proceed without audio.

### Limitation

- The docs should not promise every container will always carry audio. The code checks support first and may disable audio for unsupported browsers or containers.

---

## FFmpeg Export

The FFmpeg path is a separate CPU-based export pipeline.

### Current Build Characteristics

- Loads the FFmpeg core from the local `/ffmpeg` path on demand.
- Uses a single synchronous `callMain()` execution model.
- Blocks the UI while encoding is running.
- Reports progress from FFmpeg log output where possible.

### Supported Video Codecs

- ProRes
- DNxHR / DNxHD family
- FFV1
- UTVideo
- MJPEG

### Supported Containers

- MOV
- MP4
- MKV
- WebM
- AVI
- MXF

### Current Limitations

- HAP is not available in this build.
- This build does not expose a shared decoder pool.
- Multi-threaded mode is only reported as a capability check; the exported core path is still synchronous.
- `callMain()` blocks while encoding, so it is not the same runtime profile as the WebCodecs path.

---

## FCPXML Export

FCPXML export is separate from video rendering.

### What It Exports

- Timeline structure
- Clip timing and track layout
- Basic audio placement

### What It Does Not Export

- Compositions are skipped
- Text clips are skipped
- The XML points back to media by file reference, so it is an interchange file, not a self-contained rendered deliverable

### Limitation

- This is useful for NLE round-tripping, not for final media delivery.

---

## Frame Export

The PNG frame export action reads the current composited frame from the GPU.

### Current Path

- `engine.readPixels()` reads the frame back from GPU memory.
- The pixels are copied into a canvas.
- The canvas is then exported as a PNG file.

### Limitation

- This path is a CPU readback. It is correct, but it is not a zero-copy route.

---

## Export Process Notes

### WebCodecs / HTMLVideo

1. Prepare clips and runtimes for the selected export mode.
2. Seek all clips to each export time.
3. Build layers for that frame.
4. Render through the GPU engine.
5. Capture a `VideoFrame` from the export canvas when possible, otherwise fall back to pixel readback.
6. Encode and mux the file.

### FFmpeg

1. Render each frame through the GPU engine.
2. Read pixels from the GPU.
3. Collect frames in memory.
4. Extract audio if enabled.
5. Run FFmpeg encoding.

### Limitation

- Neither path is background rendering. Both depend on the current browser session.

---

## Current Limitations

- Preview and export are separate pipelines, even though they reuse the same engine.
- Precise export still depends on browser media readiness and seek behavior.
- FFmpeg export is blocking.
- The exporter does not currently provide a true multi-pass render pipeline.
