## Importing Media

### Supported Formats

| Type | Formats |
|------|---------|
| **Video** | MP4, WebM, MOV, AVI, MKV, WMV, M4V, FLV |
| **Audio** | WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, AAC, M4A, WMA, AIFF, OPUS |
| **Image** | PNG, JPG/JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, SVG |
| **Vector Animation** | `.lottie`, Lottie JSON (`.json`, content-sniffed) |

The panel also accepts a few specialized asset types that flow into the timeline as 3D clips:

- `model` files: OBJ, glTF/GLB, FBX
- `gaussian-splat` files: PLY, SPLAT

Lottie imports are treated as first-class media items. `.json` files are only accepted when their contents actually match Lottie structure, so arbitrary JSON data is not misclassified as animation.

### Import Methods

#### Import Button
Click the **Import** button in the panel header. Uses the File System Access API when available (Chrome/Edge) for native file picker with persistent handles, or falls back to a standard file input.

#### Add Dropdown
Click the **+ Add** button for creating new items:
- **Composition** - New composition (uses active comp's output resolution)
- **Folder** - New folder for organization
- **Text** - New text item (placed in auto-created "Text" folder)
- **3D Text** - New 3D text mesh item
- **Solid** - New solid color item (placed in auto-created "Solids" folder)
- **Camera** - New camera item
- **Splat Effector** - New splat-effector item
- **Mesh** ▶ - Submenu with 3D primitive meshes (placed in auto-created "Meshes" folder):
  - Cube, Sphere, Plane, Cylinder, Torus, Cone
  - Creates a `MeshItem` which can be dragged to the timeline as a 3D clip
- **Adjustment Layer** - Coming soon
- **Gaussian Splat** - Import a gaussian-splat asset directly from the add menu

#### Drag and Drop
- Drag files directly from the OS file explorer into the Media Panel
- Drag folders directly into the panel; nested folders are recreated inside the project
- Multiple files supported
- Attempts to acquire file handles via `getAsFileSystemHandle` for persistence
- Falls back to legacy directory-entry walking where needed
- Falls back to standard File objects when handles are unavailable

### Import Pipeline

Imports use a two-phase approach:

1. **Phase 1 (instant):** A placeholder entry appears immediately in the panel with `isImporting: true`, showing file name and size
2. **Phase 2 (background):** Full processing runs in the background:
   - Media info extraction (dimensions, duration, FPS, codec, bitrate, audio detection)
   - Thumbnail generation (for video and image files)
   - File hash calculation (for deduplication and proxy matching)
   - Copy to project RAW folder when `copyMediaToProject` is enabled, or when the import is forced
   - Existing proxy detection (by file hash)

**Deduplication:** Files with matching name + size are automatically skipped.

**Batch processing:** When importing multiple files, up to 3 files are processed in parallel.

If a project-local `Raw/` copy is created, that copy becomes the canonical source for the imported asset. The store promotes the copied handle so later reloads and exports do not depend on the original file.

### File System Access API
When supported (Chrome/Edge):
- Native file picker via `showOpenFilePicker`
- Persistent file handles stored in IndexedDB
- Path information preserved
- Handles from drag-and-drop also captured when available
- If the same media is also copied into the project `Raw/` folder, that project copy is preferred on reload

### Large File Handling
| Size | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| < 500MB | Full thumbnails generated |
| > 500MB | Thumbnail generation skipped |

### Solid Color Items
- Created via Add dropdown or context menu
- Uses active composition dimensions (fallback: 1920x1080)
- Default duration: 5 seconds
- Color picker for customization via Solid Settings dialog
- Placed in auto-created "Solids" folder
- Drag to timeline to create solid color clips

### Text Items
- Created via Add dropdown
- Default text: "New Text", font: Arial 48px white
- Default duration: 5 seconds
- Placed in auto-created "Text" folder
- Drag to timeline to create text clips
- **Note:** These are defaults for Media Panel text items (Arial, 48px). Timeline text clips use different defaults: Roboto, 72px (from `DEFAULT_TEXT_PROPERTIES` in `stores/timeline/constants.ts`).
- See [Text Clips](./Text-Clips.md) for full details

---

## View Modes

The panel supports two view modes through a single header toggle button that swaps between list and grid icons. The selected mode is persisted in `localStorage`.

### List View (default)
- Table layout with sortable, reorderable columns
- Nested folder tree with expand/collapse arrows
- Column headers for sorting and drag-to-reorder
- Resizable name column (120px - 500px range, saved to localStorage)

### Grid View
- Thumbnail grid with file names below each item
- Folder navigation via breadcrumb bar
- Double-click folders to navigate into them
- Breadcrumb shows full path from root, each segment is clickable
- Hover tooltip shows detailed metadata (resolution, duration, codec, bitrate, file size)
- Duration badge overlay on video and composition thumbnails
- Item count badge on folder thumbnails

---

## Source Thumbnail Cache

Video thumbnails are generated per source media file, not per clip instance.

- Generation runs at roughly **1 thumbnail per second of source media**
- Split and trimmed clips reuse the same source thumbnail set instead of regenerating thumbnails
- Thumbnails are cached in IndexedDB and promoted into an in-memory URL cache on load
- The cache can also be reused by file hash when the same source is imported again
- Large files above the thumbnail threshold skip this generation path entirely

---

## Folder Organization

### Creating Folders
1. Add dropdown -> Folder
2. Or right-click -> New Folder
3. Folders are created expanded by default

### Folder Features
- **Nested folders** supported
- **Drag-and-drop** items into folders (single or multi-select)
- **Expand/collapse** tree view (list mode) or navigate into (grid mode)
- **Cycle detection** prevents dropping a folder into itself or its descendants
- **Label colors** assignable to folders

### Operations
```typescript
createFolder(name, parentId?)     // Create folder (returns MediaFolder)
removeFolder(id)                  // Delete (moves children to parent)
renameFolder(id, name)            // Rename
toggleFolderExpanded(id)          // Toggle expand/collapse
moveToFolder(itemIds[], folderId) // Move items (null = root)
```

---

## Compositions

### Creating Compositions
1. Add dropdown -> Composition
2. Created with settings from `settingsStore.outputResolution`
3. Default duration: 60 seconds, frame rate: 30 fps
4. Starts with one Video track and one Audio track

### Composition Settings Dialog
Edit via right-click -> Composition Settings:
- Width and height
- Frame rate
- Duration
- Resizing adjusts clip transforms to maintain pixel positions

### Composition Operations
```typescript
createComposition(name, settings?)   // Create with optional overrides
duplicateComposition(id)             // Creates "Name Copy"
removeComposition(id)                // Delete
updateComposition(id, updates)       // Update settings
openCompositionTab(id, options?)     // Edit in timeline (with animation)
closeCompositionTab(id)              // Close tab
reorderCompositionTabs(from, to)     // Drag to reorder tabs
setActiveComposition(id)             // Switch active composition
getActiveComposition()               // Get current composition
getOpenCompositions()                // List open tabs
```

### Tab System
- Compositions open as tabs in the timeline
- Tab switching saves current timeline state and loads the new composition's state
- Animated transitions (exit/enter) when switching between compositions
- Synced playhead when navigating into/out of nested compositions

### Nested Compositions
- Drag composition to timeline to create a nested comp clip
- Double-click composition clip to navigate into it
- Playhead position syncs between parent and nested compositions
- Changes in nested comp reflect in parent timeline

### Source Monitor
- Double-click a video or image file to open it in the source monitor
- Sets `sourceMonitorFileId` in the store

---

## Proxy Generation

### Project-Based Proxy System
Proxies require an open project (via `projectFileService`). For large video files:
1. Right-click video -> Generate Proxy
2. Proxy frames are generated and stored in the project folder

### How It Works
- Video is decoded frame-by-frame using `proxyGenerator`
- Frames are saved individually to the project's proxy storage via `projectFileService`
- Audio is extracted separately in the background (non-blocking)
- Generation can be cancelled; partial proxies are preserved
- Resumed automatically if a partial proxy exists on disk

### Proxy Settings
```typescript
FPS: 30  // Constant frame rate for proxy
```

### Proxy Completion
A proxy is considered complete when >= 98% of expected frames are available:
```typescript
frameCount >= Math.ceil(duration * PROXY_FPS) * 0.98
```

### Progress Tracking
```typescript
interface MediaFile {
  proxyStatus: 'none' | 'generating' | 'ready' | 'error';
  proxyProgress: number;      // 0-100
  proxyFrameCount?: number;   // Total frames generated
  proxyFps?: number;          // Always 30
  hasProxyAudio?: boolean;    // Audio proxy extracted
}
```

### Proxy Mode
Toggle proxy playback mode via `proxyEnabled` / `toggleProxyEnabled()`:
- When enabled, mutes all video elements in the timeline
- Uses proxy frames instead of original video for playback

### Visual Indicators
| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **P** (blue) | Proxy ready |
| **P** (filling animation) + **X%** | Generating, with progress |

---

## Selection

### Click Selection
- **Click** - Select single item
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Click** - Toggle item in selection
- **Shift + Click** - Add to selection

### Marquee Selection
- Click and drag on empty space in the item list to draw a selection rectangle
- 4px movement threshold before marquee activates
- Hold **Ctrl/Cmd** while marquee selecting to add to existing selection
- Works in both list and grid view modes

### Label Colors
16 AE-style label colors assignable to any item (files, folders, compositions, text, solids):

`none`, `red`, `yellow`, `blue`, `green`, `purple`, `orange`, `pink`, `cyan`, `brown`, `lavender`, `peach`, `seafoam`, `fuchsia`, `tan`, `aqua`

Click the label dot in the list view to open the color picker. When multiple items are selected, the color is applied to all selected items.

## Media Properties

### Column Display (List View)
The media list displays items in a table with the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Name** | File name with AE-style file type icon | Video.mp4 |
| **Label** | Colored dot indicator (clickable) | colored circle |
| **Duration** | Clip length (m:ss) | 4:02 |
| **Resolution** | Width x Height | 1920x1080 |
| **FPS** | Frame rate (video) or composition frame rate | 25 |
| **Container** | File container format | MP4, MKV, WebM |
| **Codec** | Video codec | H.264, VP9, AV1 |
| **Audio** | Has audio track? | Yes / No |
| **Bitrate** | Data rate | 12.5 Mbps |
| **Size** | File size | 125.4 MB |

### Column Customization

**Sortable Columns:**
- Click column header to sort ascending
- Click again for descending
- Click a third time to remove sort
- Folders always sort separately (stay at top)

**Reorderable Columns:**
- Drag column headers to rearrange order
- Order is saved in localStorage (`media-panel-column-order`)

**Resize Name Column:**
- Drag the vertical resize handle on the right edge of the Name column
- Width range: 120px - 500px
- Width saved in localStorage (`media-panel-name-width`)

### Status Badges (in Name column)
| Badge | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **P** (blue) | Proxy ready |
| **P** (filling) + % | Proxy generating |
| **T** (green) | Fully transcribed - click to open transcript |
| **T** (filling) | Partially transcribed - shows coverage % |
| **A** (orange) | Fully analyzed - click to open analysis |
| **A** (filling) | Partially analyzed - shows coverage % |

Clicking transcript or analysis badges selects the corresponding clip in the timeline and opens the clip properties panel.

### Metadata Interface
```typescript
interface MediaFile {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'video' | 'audio' | 'image' | 'lottie' | 'rive';

## Drag to Timeline

### Process
1. Select media in panel
2. Drag to timeline
3. Drop on appropriate track

### Drag Types
| Item Type | Drag Payload Kind | Data Transfer Key |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Media file (video/image/lottie) | `media-file` | `application/x-media-file-id` |
| Media file (audio) | `media-file` (marked as audio) | `application/x-media-file-id` |
| Composition | `composition` | `application/x-composition-id` |
| Text item | `text` | `application/x-text-item-id` |
| Solid item | `solid` | `application/x-solid-item-id` |
| Mesh item | `mesh` | `application/x-mesh-item-id` |
| Folder | Internal move only (no timeline drop) | — |

### Drop Behavior
- Creates clip from media source
- Uses actual media duration
- Audio-only files restricted to audio tracks
- Files still importing or missing cannot be dragged to timeline
- Compositions cannot be dragged into themselves (active comp check)
- Mesh items create 3D clips with `is3D: true` and `meshType` (rendered via Three.js)

### Track Type Enforcement
| Media Type | Allowed Tracks |
|------------|----------------|
| Video/Image/Lottie/Composition/Text/Solid/Mesh | Video tracks only |
| Audio | Audio tracks only |

---

## Project Integration

### Auto-Save
Media references are saved with the project file, while IndexedDB keeps the handle cache and other reload helpers:
- File metadata (name, type, dimensions, duration, codec, etc.)
- File handles (for reload on next session)
- Folder structure
- Composition state with timeline data
- Text items and solid items (via localStorage)
- When present, `projectPath` points at the copied `Raw/<name>` file and is used for automatic relinking

### Restoration
On project load:
- Project-local `Raw/` copies are tried first and become the canonical source when available
- Media metadata restored from IndexedDB and project JSON
- File handles used to restore file access when no `Raw/` copy is available
- Thumbnails restored from `Cache/thumbnails` by file hash
- Existing proxies detected automatically, including legacy media-id based storage
- Existing transcripts and analysis data loaded from the project folder
- Dead blob/object URLs are regenerated for available files
- If a retained `File` object is still present, image/video thumbnails are rebuilt when needed after refresh
- Folder structure, expansion state, dock layout, and per-composition view state restored

### Media File IDs
- Each media has a unique timestamp-based ID
- Clips reference media by `mediaFileId`
- Survives project reload
- File hash used for proxy and thumbnail deduplication across reimports

---

## Media Relinking

### Relink Dialog
When media files lose access (e.g., after browser restart):
1. **Automatic detection** - Panel shows "Relink (N)" button when files need reload
2. **Relink dialog** - Click the button to open the relink interface
3. Files dimmed in list with `no-file` styling when unavailable

### Reload Strategy
Files are reloaded in priority order:
1. **Project RAW folder** - If the asset was copied into the project and the project is open
2. **Stored file handle** - Re-access the original file location, including permission re-checks

On project load, the app also tries to auto-relink missing files silently from `Raw/` and then falls back to stored handles in IndexedDB. This is case-insensitive on filename only; there is no content-hash relink pass.

### Double-Click Reload
Double-clicking a file that has lost access triggers a single-file reload attempt with permission request.

### Visual Indicators
| State | Appearance |
|-------|------------|
| File missing/needs reload | Row dimmed, `no-file` class |
| File importing | `importing` class with loading state |
| Proxy available | Blue "P" badge |

---

## Store Architecture

The media store is split into modular slices:

| Slice | File | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **fileImportSlice** | `slices/fileImportSlice.ts` | Import via picker, drag-drop, handles |
| **fileManageSlice** | `slices/fileManageSlice.ts` | Remove, rename, reload files |
| **compositionSlice** | `slices/compositionSlice.ts` | CRUD, tabs, active composition switching |
| **slotSlice** | `slices/slotSlice.ts` | Resolume-style slot grid assignments |
| **multiLayerSlice** | `slices/multiLayerSlice.ts` | Multi-layer playback activation |
| **folderSlice** | `slices/folderSlice.ts` | Folder CRUD and expand/collapse |
| **selectionSlice** | `slices/selectionSlice.ts` | Selection, move-to-folder, label colors |
| **proxySlice** | `slices/proxySlice.ts` | Proxy generation, cancellation, progress |
| **projectSlice** | `slices/projectSlice.ts` | Save, load, init from DB |

**Inline actions (in `index.ts`):** `createTextItem`, `removeTextItem`, `getOrCreateTextFolder`, `createSolidItem`, `removeSolidItem`, `updateSolidItem`, `getOrCreateSolidFolder`, `createMeshItem`, `removeMeshItem`, `getOrCreateMeshFolder`, `getItemsByFolder`, `getItemById`, `getFileByName`.

**Boot Sequence:** `init.ts` handles IndexedDB initialization, timeline restore from saved state, status synchronization, auto-save interval setup, beforeunload handler, and audio cleanup via `disposeAllAudio()`.

Helper modules in `helpers/`:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `importPipeline.ts` | Unified import processing -- orchestrates the two-phase import (placeholder then background processing) |
| `mediaInfoHelpers.ts` | Codec detection, metadata extraction (uses mp4box for MP4 container parsing) |
| `thumbnailHelpers.ts` | Thumbnail generation, deduplication by file hash, skip logic for large files |
| `fileHashHelpers.ts` | File hash calculation for deduplication and proxy matching |
