## Panel System

### Dockable Behavior

All docked panels can be:

- Dragged to rearrange
- Grouped in tabs
- Resized via split panes
- Closed and reopened from the View menu
- Floated as independent windows
- Maximized from the hovered tab with the fullscreen shortcut

### Tab Controls

| Action | Method |
|--------|--------|
| Switch tab | Click |
| Cycle tabs | Middle mouse scroll |
| Drag tab | Hold for 500 ms, then drag |
| Maximize hovered tab | Hover a dock tab and use the fullscreen shortcut |

### Floating Panels

- Floating panels keep their own position, size, and z-order
- They can be brought to the front by clicking
- They can be redocked by dragging onto a dock target

- View mode buttons include RGB, R, G, B, and Luma
- IRE reference remains available
- The scopes are fully GPU-rendered

---

## Slot Grid

Resolume-style slot grid for simultaneous multi-layer composition playback. The grid overlays the Timeline panel and lets each slot run on its own wall-clock time.

### Grid Layout

- 4 rows by 12 columns
- Rows A through D represent playback layers
- Column headers let you activate an entire column
- Slots show a mini timeline preview of the assigned composition

### Opening the Slot Grid

| Method | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Toolbar toggle | Switches between the normal timeline and Slot Grid |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Scroll Down` | Zoom out from Timeline into Slot Grid view |
| `Ctrl+Shift+Scroll Up` | Zoom back into Timeline while hovering a filled slot |

### Slot Interaction

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Click a filled slot | Select slot clip settings, open the Slot Clip tab, and either open the comp in the editor or trigger it live depending on `useLiveSlotTrigger` |
| Re-click an active slot | Restart playback from the beginning |
| Click an empty slot | Deactivate that layer |
| Click a column header | Activate all compositions in that column |
| Drag a slot | Reorder or swap a composition position |
| Right-click a filled slot | Open in Editor or Remove from Slot |

### Multi-Layer Playback

- Each layer tracks elapsed time independently
- Active layers loop automatically
- Background layer audio is muted by default
- Deactivating a layer returns control to the next active layer if needed
- Optional warm-deck badges show slot preparation state when `useWarmSlotDecks` is enabled

See [Slot Grid](./Slot-Grid.md) for the current live/deck behavior, slot-clip trimming, and context-menu actions.

## Properties Panel

The unified Properties panel adapts its tabs to the selected clip type and to slot-grid mode.

| **Effects** | GPU effects list with parameters |
| **Masks** | Mask shapes with mode and feather controls |

## Dock Layouts

### Default Layout

The built-in desktop layout is a three-column dock:

- Left column: Media, AI Chat, AI Video, Downloads
- Center: Preview
- Right column: Export, Properties, Waveform, Histogram, Vectorscope
- Bottom: Timeline

Multi Preview is available from the View menu and can be floated or docked, but it is not pinned in the default layout.

### Layout Persistence

- The dock layout is persisted with Zustand and project state
- Floating panels are restored across sessions
- Invalid panel types are cleaned up on load
- Named layouts can be stored in the View menu and reused later
- A saved layout can be marked as the default layout

### Layout Actions

| Action | Location |
|--------|----------|
| Save Current Layout | View -> Layouts |
| Load Saved Layout | View -> Layouts |
| Set Current as Default | View -> Layouts |
| Set Saved Layout as Default | View -> Layouts |
| Load Default Layout | View -> Layouts |

## MIDI Control

### Enabling MIDI

Window menu -> MIDI Control

### Requirements

- Browser Web MIDI API support
- MIDI device connected
- Permission granted

### Status Display

```
MIDI Control (N devices)
```

---

## Resolution Settings

### Output Resolution

Configured in Settings -> Output.

| Preset | Dimensions |
|--------|------------|
| 1080p | 1920 x 1080 |
| 1440p | 2560 x 1440 |
| 4K | 3840 x 2160 |
| 9:16 | 1080 x 1920 |

Custom width and height are also supported. This applies to newly created compositions; the active composition can still be configured per item in the Media panel.

### Preview Quality

Configured in Settings -> Previews.

| Option | Render Size |
|--------|-------------|
| Full | 100% |
| Half | 50% |
| Quarter | 25% |

Lower preview quality reduces GPU workload and memory use on engine-backed preview targets. It does not change export resolution or the HTML-only source monitor.

Hosted cloud access is account/session based and does not depend on a user-entered API key in this dialog.
