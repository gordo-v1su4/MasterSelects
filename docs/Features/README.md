# MasterSelects Documentation

Current feature documentation for the `staging` branch.

Version 1.5.3 | April 2026

---

## Overview

MasterSelects is a browser-based WebGPU compositor and media editor with timeline editing, nested compositions, AI-assisted workflows, project-local media management, and an optional native helper for the browser gaps that still matter.

The docs in this folder were re-audited against the current codebase and now track the active implementation instead of older roadmap claims.

### Current Highlights

| Capability | Description |
|---|---|
| **WebGPU Rendering** | Shared render path for main preview, independent targets, output windows, and export |
| **Timeline Editing** | Multi-track editing, nested compositions, markers, shortcuts, and keyframes |
| **AI Control** | OpenAI chat with 79 exported tools plus local/native bridge access for external agents |
| **AI Video Workspace** | Classic AI Video plus FlashBoard board-mode generation and media import |
| **3D Layers** | Three.js layers, camera clips, Gaussian splats, and splat effectors |
| **Vector Animation** | Lottie clips with deterministic canvas playback, looping, and export |
| **Audio** | Element-synced playback, drift correction, waveform extraction, EQ, and audio export |
| **Project Storage** | `project.json` source of truth, RAW-copy-first media flow, autosave, relink, backups |
| **Native Helper** | Firefox storage backend, yt-dlp download flow, local AI bridge, native jobs |
| **Security And Debugging** | Token-gated bridges, allowed-root file policy, playback monitors, logger tooling |

## Audit Notes

- The authoritative app version is [`src/version.ts`](../../src/version.ts), currently `1.5.3`.
- Preview quality is wired into engine-backed preview resolution through `useEngine()`; it does not affect export resolution or the HTML-only source monitor.
- `openComposition` and `searchVideos` are still the two known AI dispatch gaps.
- Gaussian AI tool definitions exist in code but are not exported through `AI_TOOLS` yet.
- This index intentionally points to implementation docs, not roadmap claims.
