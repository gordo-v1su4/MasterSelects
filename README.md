## What Makes This Different

Most browser-based video editors share a pattern: Canvas 2D compositing, heavyweight dependency trees, and CPU-bound rendering that falls apart at scale. This project takes a fundamentally different approach.

**GPU-first architecture.** Preview, scrubbing, and export all run through the same **WebGPU ping-pong compositor**. Video textures are imported as `texture_external` (**zero-copy**, no CPU roundtrip). **37 blend modes**, 3D rotation, and inline color effects all execute in a **single WGSL composite shader** per layer. No Three.js, no GSAP, no Canvas 2D fallback in the hot path.

**Zero-copy export pipeline.** Frames are captured as `new VideoFrame(offscreenCanvas)` directly from the GPU canvas. **No `readPixels()`**, no `getImageData()`, no staging buffers in the default path. The GPU renders, **WebCodecs encodes**. That's it.

**3-tier scrubbing cache.** **300 GPU textures in VRAM** for instant scrub (Tier 1), per-video last-frame cache for seek transitions (Tier 2), and a **900-frame RAM Preview** with CPU/GPU promotion (Tier 3). When the cache is warm, **scrubbing doesn't decode at all**.

**13 production dependencies.** React, Zustand, mp4box, mp4/webm muxers, HuggingFace Transformers, ONNX Runtime, SoundTouch, WebGPU types, plus an **experimental FFmpeg WASM path**. **Everything else is custom-built from scratch**: the entire WebGPU compositor, all 30 effect shaders, the keyframe animation system, the export engine, the audio mixer, the text renderer, the mask engine, the video scope renderers, the dock/panel system, the timeline UI. Zero runtime abstraction layers between your timeline and the GPU.

**Nested composition rendering.** Compositions within compositions, each with their own resolution. Rendered to **pooled GPU textures** with frame-level caching, composited in the parent's ping-pong pass, all in a **single `device.queue.submit()`**.

**On-device AI.** SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2) runs entirely in-browser via ONNX Runtime. Click to select objects in the preview, propagate masks across frames. No server, no API key, no upload. ~220MB model loaded on demand.

## Why I Built This

No Adobe subscription, no patience for cracks, and every free online editor felt like garbage. I wanted something that actually works: fast in the browser, GPU-first, built for real editing instead of templates, and open enough that AI can steer the timeline instead of just suggesting ideas.

**The vision:** an editor where AI can directly operate the tool. The built-in chat connects to OpenAI and exposes **76 editing tools**. External agents can steer the running editor over a local HTTP bridge, and in development the Vite bridge still exists too. Live outputs still matter too - I've been doing video art for 16 years, so multi-output routing was never optional.

Built with Claude as my pair-programmer. Every feature gets debugged, refactored, and beaten into shape until it does what I need. ~120k lines of TypeScript, ~2,500 lines of WGSL, and a Rust native helper for the stuff browsers still can't do cleanly.

---

## AI Control

MasterSelects is being built around the idea that AI should be able to *do the edit*, not just talk about it.

- **Built-in editor chat:** OpenAI-powered, with direct access to 76 timeline/media/editing tools
- **External agent bridge:** Claude Code or any other agent can drive the running editor via the Native Helper HTTP bridge
- **Experimental multicam AI:** Claude/Anthropic generates edit decision lists for the multicam workflow
- **On-device AI:** SAM2 segmentation in-browser via ONNX Runtime, plus local Whisper transcription via Transformers.js

Example Native Helper bridge call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9877/api/ai-tools \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <startup-token>" \
  -d '{"tool":"_list","args":{}}'
```

This requires the Native Helper to be running, a MasterSelects editor tab to be connected, and the helper startup token. The Vite `/api/ai-tools` bridge still exists in development, but it is now gated by a per-session token as well.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
```

**Requirements:** Chrome 113+ with WebGPU support is the main target. Dedicated GPU recommended.

> **Firefox:** project storage requires the Native Helper backend because Firefox does not support the File System Access API flow used by Chrome.

> **Linux:** Enable Vulkan for smooth 60fps: `chrome://flags/#enable-vulkan`

---

## Native Helper

Cross-platform Rust companion app for the parts browsers still can't do well. Required for Firefox project storage and for yt-dlp-based downloads.

```bash
cd tools/native-helper
cargo run --release    # WebSocket :9876, HTTP :9877
```

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| **Storage** | Native project persistence backend for Firefox |
| **AI Control** | Local HTTP bridge for external agents to steer the running editor |
| **Download** | yt-dlp integration for YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X, Vimeo, and other supported sites |

**Export codecs:** H.264, H.265, VP9, AV1 via WebCodecs (production). ProRes, DNxHR, FFV1, UTVideo, MJPEG via experimental FFmpeg WASM path (single-threaded, requires custom build).

**Platforms:** Windows, Linux, macOS. Building the Native Helper requires Rust. Downloads also require `yt-dlp`. See [Native Helper docs](tools/native-helper/README.md) for platform-specific setup.

---

## Security Model

MasterSelects is local-first: editing, rendering, caching, and most analysis stay in the browser unless you explicitly invoke an external provider or the Native Helper.

- **API keys:** stored in IndexedDB with per-browser Web Crypto encryption. This protects against casual inspection, not against same-origin script execution.
- **Dev bridge:** sensitive Vite routes require a per-session Bearer token and only accept localhost browser origins.
- **Native Helper:** binds to `127.0.0.1` and requires a random startup token for HTTP and WebSocket bridge operations.
- **Local file access:** limited to explicit roots such as the project root, temp, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, and Videos, plus optional `MASTERSELECTS_ALLOWED_FILE_ROOTS`.
- **Key export:** `.keys.enc` export/import is disabled until passphrase-based encryption is implemented.

See [Security docs](docs/Features/Security.md) for the trust model and known limitations, and [Native Helper docs](tools/native-helper/README.md) for auth examples.

## Known Issues

This is alpha software. Features get added fast, things break.

- FFmpeg WASM export is still work in progress
- Multicam AI is experimental
- Transitions are experimental
- Firefox project storage requires the Native Helper backend
- Video downloads require Native Helper with yt-dlp installed
- Audio waveforms may not display for some video formats
- Very long videos (>2 hours) may cause performance issues

If something breaks, refresh. If it's still broken, [open an issue](https://github.com/Sportinger/MasterSelects/issues).
